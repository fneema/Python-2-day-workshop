    "# Writing Functions and  Loops\n",
    "In Python, there are built-in functions which you may have probably come across. An example is the **print()** function. However, there are often many times when you need to write your own function to help you solve a problem. We call this **User defined functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may be wondering what a function is in the first place?, When and why do I need it?, and most importantly how do we create one. These are very good questions to be thinking about now, but do not worry because WPSYG will digest everything for you soon.\n",

    "**So what is a function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A function simply takes a set of inputs, process them and then produces some output. For instance, I  can have a function that takes your height and weight as input, and then gives your body mass index (BMI) as output. Inside the function, the height and weight are combined to produce the BMI. An already familiar function which we mentioned earlier is the *print()* function. This function takes some statements as input, and then  prints them out.\n",
