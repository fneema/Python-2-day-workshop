There will be break-out sessions where you can get comfortable with what you have learnt. This will ensure you fully understand the various aspects of the tutorial and you will be able to ask your questions in those rooms. In this course, you will perform arithmetic operations on numbers, import python packages for solving different programming problems and also get creative in solving some specific tasks. "

    "\n",
    "2. Machine learning – There are many machine learning applications written in Python. Machine learning is a way to write a logic so that a machine can learn and solve a particular problem on its own. For example, products recommendation in websites like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay etc. is a machine learning algorithm that recognises user’s interest. Face recognition and Voice recognition in your phone is another example of machine learning.\n",
